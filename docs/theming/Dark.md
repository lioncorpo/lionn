# Dark Theme

The [Material dark theme system][dark-theme-mdc-spec] can be used to create a
beautiful and functional dark theme for your app, which generally consists of
dark background colors and light foreground colors for elements such as text and
iconography.

Some of the most common benefits of a dark theme include conserving battery
power for devices with OLED screens, reducing eye strain, and facilitating use
in low-light environments.

Starting with [Android Q][dark-theme-dac-docs], users are now able to switch
their device into dark theme via a new system setting, which applies to both the
Android system UI and apps running on the device.

## Design & API Documentation

-   [Android Q Dark Theme Documentation][dark-theme-dac-docs]
-   [AppCompat DayNight Documentation][daynight-appcompat-docs]

## Setup

In order to support the dark theme functionality in Android Q, make sure you are
depending on the `1.1.0` stable version of the
[Material Android library][maven-repo-mdc] or later, and update your app theme
to inherit from `Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight` (or one of its descendants).
E.g.:

**res/values/themes.xml**

```xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight">
    <!-- ... -->
</style>
```

Alternatively, if you want to define separate `Light` and `Dark` themes for your
app, you can inherit from `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light` in the `values`
directory, and `Theme.MaterialComponents` in the `values-night` directory. E.g.:

**res/values/themes.xml**

```xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light">
    <!-- ... -->
</style>
```

**res/values-night/themes.xml**

```xml
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents">
    <!-- ... -->
</style>
```

The `Theme.MaterialComponents` theme is a static dark theme, whereas
`Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight` is a more dynamic theme which will help
facilitate easy switching between your app's `Light` and `Dark` theme. If using
a `DayNight` theme, you can define one app theme that references color
resources, which can be overridden in the `values-night` directory if needed.

## Catalog

To see how Material components adapt in a dark theme, build and run the
[Catalog app](../catalog-app.md) and enable dark theme in one of the following
ways:

*   Any API Level: Overflow menu on Catalog home screen
*   Android Q: `Settings > Display > Dark Theme` (or Dark Theme tile in Notification Tray)
*   Android P: `Settings > System > Developer options > Night mode`

## Color Palette

At the core of any dark theme is a color palette that uses dark background
colors and light foreground colors. The Material `Dark` themes make use of the
[Material Color System](Color.md), in order to provide default dark theme values
for neutral palette colors such as `colorBackground` and `colorSurface`.

The baseline Material `Dark` theme background and surface colors are dark grey
instead of black, which increases visibility for shadows and also reduces eye
strain for light text.

The Material `Dark` themes also provide adjusted defaults for the baseline
branded palette, including `colorPrimary` and `colorSecondary`. See the
[Material Dark Theme spec][dark-theme-mdc-spec-ui-application] for guidance on
how you can adjust your brand colors for dark theme.

### Primary vs. Surface Coloring for Large Surfaces

According to the
[Material Dark Theme spec][dark-theme-mdc-spec-custom-application], large
surfaces should not use bright background colors because they can emit too much
brightness. When applicable, the Material themes will provide this behavior
out-of-the-box, e.g., by having the `Light` theme default to
`Widget.MaterialComponents.AppBarLayout.Primary` and the `Dark` theme default to
`Widget.MaterialComponents.AppBarLayout.Surface`.

However, there may be some cases where you need to apply this primary vs.
surface color swap to some custom UI. For convenience, the Material themes
provide a `colorPrimarySurface` attribute, that points to `colorPrimary` in the
`Light` theme and `colorSurface` in the `Dark` theme. There is also a
corresponding `colorOnPrimarySurface` attribute that can be used for foreground
elements such as text and iconography on top of a `colorPrimarySurface`
background.

Additionally, the Material Android library provides `PrimarySurface` styles for
components that act as large surfaces and commonly use `colorPrimary` for their
background in light theme. These styles will automatically switch between the
component's primary colored style in light theme and surface colored style in
dark theme. E.g.:

* `Widget.MaterialComponents.BottomAppBar.PrimarySurface`
* `Widget.MaterialComponents.BottomNavigationView.PrimarySurface`
* `Widget.MaterialComponents.TabLayout.PrimarySurface`
* `Widget.MaterialComponents.Toolbar.PrimarySurface`

## Elevation Overlays

In addition to the color palette adjustments mentioned above, communicating the
hierarchy of a UI via elevation requires some dark theme specific
considerations.

Shadows are less effective in an app using a dark theme, because they will have
less contrast with the dark background colors and will appear to be less
visible. In order to compensate for this, Material surfaces in a dark theme
become lighter at higher elevations, when they are closer to the implied light
source.

This is accomplished via elevation overlays, which are semi-transparent white
(`colorOnSurface`) overlays that are conceptually placed on top of the surface
color. The semi-transparent alpha percentage is calculated using an equation
based on elevation, which results in higher alpha percentages at higher
elevations, and therefore lighter surfaces.

Note: we avoid overdraw with the elevation overlays by calculating a composite
blend of the surface color with the overlay color and using that as the
surface's background, instead of drawing another layer to the canvas.

### Affected Components

The following is a list of Material components that support elevation overlays
in dark theme, because they use `colorSurface` and can be elevated:

*   [Top App Bar](../components/TopAppBar.md)
*   [Bottom App Bar](../components/BottomAppBar.md)
*   [Bottom Navigation](../components/BottomNavigation.md)
*   [Tabs](../components/Tabs.md)
*   [Card](../components/Card.md)
*   [Dialog](../components/Dialog.md)
*   [Menu](../components/Menu.md)
*   [Bottom Sheet](../components/BottomSheetBehavior.md)
*   [Navigation Drawer](../components/NavigationDrawer.md)
*   [Switch](../components/Switch.md)

### Theme Attributes

In order to facilitate some orchestration around the elevation overlays, we have
the following theme attributes:

Attribute Name              |Description                                                                          |Default Value
----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
`elevationOverlayEnabled`   |Whether the elevation overlay functionality is enabled.                              |`false` in `Light` themes, `true` in `Dark` themes
`elevationOverlayColor`     |The color used for the elevation overlays, applied at an alpha based on elevation.   |`colorOnSurface`

Note: If inheriting from the `Theme.MaterialComponents` theme or a descendant,
you most likely do not have to set these attributes yourself because the
Material themes already set up the above defaults.

### Custom Views & Non-Material Components

If you would like to apply dark theme elevation overlays to your custom views or
any non-Material views that are elevated surfaces, then you can use the
`MaterialShapeDrawable` or `ElevationOverlayProvider` APIs.

#### MaterialShapeDrawable

The key to supporting elevation overlays in a custom view is creating a
`MaterialShapeDrawable` with the overlay support enabled via
`MaterialShapeDrawable#createWithElevationOverlay`, and setting it as the
background of your view.

Next, override the `View#setElevation` method and forward the elevation passed
in to your `MaterialShapeDrawable` background's `setElevation` method.

`MaterialShapeDrawable` is the preferred approach for custom views because it
will keep track of the elevation value for you and factor that in to the overlay
any time elevation changes, and you don't have to worry about incorrectly
compounding the overlays multiple times.

#### ElevationOverlayProvider

If you have a case where the elevation value is more static and you would like
to get the corresponding dark theme overlay color (perhaps to color an existing
view), then you can use `ElevationOverlayProvider`.

If elevation overlays are enabled at the theme level, the
`ElevationOverlayProvider#compositeOverlayWithThemeSurfaceColorIfNeeded` method
will return `colorSurface` with the overlay color blended in at an alpha level
based on the elevation passed in. Otherwise, it will simply return
`colorSurface`, so that you can use the result of this method in both `Light`
and `Dark` themes without needing any additional orchestration.

If you need to blend the overlays with an arbitrary color or an adjusted surface
color, or get access to lower level values such as the overlay alpha
percentages, take a look at the other `ElevationOverlayProvider` methods
including `compositeOverlayIfNeeded`, `compositeOverlay`, and `calculateOverlayAlpha`.

#### Absolute Elevation

When calculating the elevation overlay alpha percentage, Material components
factor in the absolute elevation of their parent view. This is because the
distance from the light source is the driving factor behind elevation overlays.

If you need to factor in absolute elevation in a custom view that supports
overlays, then you can use the `MaterialShapeUtils#setParentAbsoluteElevation`
methods when using a `MaterialShapeDrawable` background. For example:

```java
@Override
protected void onAttachedToWindow() {
  super.onAttachedToWindow();

  MaterialShapeUtils.setParentAbsoluteElevation(this);
}
```

Alternatively, you could use the `ElevationOverlayProvider` composite methods
that take in a `View` parameter or the `getParentAbsoluteElevation` method.

Note: This means that you should consider accessibility contrast ratios for
text and iconography, when deeply nesting elevated Material components and
views that support elevation overlays.
